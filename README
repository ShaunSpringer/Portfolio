Welcome to my open-source portfolio project.

Here is where I will be playing with new ideas and putting them out there for the world to see.  

The only goal of this project is to document my creative ventures through a different medium than I am used to, all while learning and trying new things.

Note: Node.js v0.6+ is required to run this project
